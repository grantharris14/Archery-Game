1.	I will write a program in Python that will draw an archery target and simulate 2 players game in 5 rounds. Using five-band scoring, a bullseye is worth 9 points and each successive ring is worth 2 fewer points down to 1 for white. The program should output a score for each click and keep track of a running sum for the entire series.
2.	 The user will be able to click to simulate each round for each player. After the user clicks 1 time, it will simulate the 3 shots a player takes and will combine the score for the total the player got in that round. After each click, it will display what the score was for each round and the total score for the players in all 5 rounds. It will also display who won the game between the two players.
